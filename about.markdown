I am Martin Bonica, an IT professional and arts enthusiast from northern Virginia. This is my website. I use this as a place to write, mostly about IT and the arts.

This personal blog does not represent the views of any of my current or prior employers.

I respectfully ask that you do not use my work for the training of commercial large language models.
